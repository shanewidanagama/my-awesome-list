# my-awesome-list
List of things I think are awesome. Inspired by other "awesome lists" found on Github.


* [Simple steps to Getting Over FOMO](https://aultman.org/blog/caring-for-you/simple-steps-to-getting-over-fomo/#/); I like their tip to pay attention, and their reasoning for it. The other tips are also worth trying, like thinking about what activities increase FOMO and setting limits to them.
* [4 tips to get over FOMO](https://www.npr.org/2022/05/16/1099226028/how-to-overcome-fomo); This breaks down FOMO in an easy to understand way. "I think the irony of all of it is it's called FOMO, the fear of missing out. But really, what it is doing is it's making you miss out on today and that warm and cozy bed that you're in right now, or the job that you're in right now or the relationship that you're in right now because you're so worried about what else is out there." Paying attention, expecially on the good things, directly deals with FOMO.
